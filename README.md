# Automation of Hydroponic Farming

## Overview

This project aims to automate the process of hydroponic farming using an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller and the Blynk app for user interface. Hydroponic farming, a method of growing plants without soil, relies heavily on precise monitoring and control of environmental conditions. This automation system simplifies the management of the hydroponic setup, improving efficiency and yield.
